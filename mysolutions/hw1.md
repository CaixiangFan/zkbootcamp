1. S = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6) 
   1. (4+4) mod 7 = 1
   2. (3*5) mod 7 = 1
   3. inverse of 3 = 5
2. S = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6} Can we consider 'S' and the operation '+' to be a group ?
   No. This combination doesn't have properties of `Closure`, `Associativity` etc.
3. -13 mode 5 = 2
4. x^3 - x^2 + 4x - 12 = 0
   positive root: 2
   degree: 3
